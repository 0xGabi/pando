# Overview

The Pando Network is a network of Decentralized Autonomous Contents relying on pando: a distributed [versioning control system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) enforcing [DAO-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization) version-control, lineage tracking and governance.


Pando is built on top of [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/), [ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) and [aragonOS](https://aragon.one/os). Its goal is to become a _de facto_ standard. Pando’s specification and implementation are thus intended to be open-source and community-driven.

One way to understand what pando is to think about it as a distributed alternative to traditional versioning systems like git. Another one is to think about it as a tool to track and govern the genesis of contents the same way an ecosystem works. A last one is to think about pando as a universal public infrastructure to create, host and link contents: softwares, writings, musics, videos, etc.

## Rationale

The core principles of both the Pando Protocol and the Pando Network are the following.

### Distributed

Pando implements a fully distributed architecture: its storage rely on IPFS / swarm while its governance schemes are enforced through smart-contracts stored and executed on the ethereum blockchain.

### Uncensorable

This distributed architecture guarantees that **contents hosted through pando are uncensorable and can survive most infrastructure breakdowns**.

### Immutable

Pando is designed to guarantee the immutability of contents. The pairing of both IPFS and the ethereum blockchain guarantees a timeless archiving of every pando-hosted content and thus that **these contents are uncensorable even by their own authors**.

This features makes pando unique in the field of versioning and archiving systems and, probably, not suited to all needs.

### Autonomous

Pando is designed to guarantee the autonomy of contents: due to its distributed architecture no one except creators can decide of their content's destiny.

### Modular

// TBD

Pando do not rely on a binary permission scheme where one is granted either full or no authority over a content. Pando is designed to grant each contributors of a content a given amount of authority over this content with respect to the « value » of their contributions.
