# Overview

## Modification tracking

A file in pando can have three different and disjoint statuses: _tracked_, _untracked_ or _ignored_.

* A _tracked file_ is a file whose modifications pando will take into account and automatically consider for snapshots.
* An _untracked file_ is a file whose modifications pando will _not_ take into account and automatically consider for snapshots.
* An _ignored_ file is a file that is completely ignored by pando.

An example output of the `gl status` command \(`foo.py` and `bar.py` are tracked files with modifications, `.gitignore` is an unmodified tracked file, `baz.py` is an untracked file and `foo.pyc` is an ignored file\):

```text
$ ls
bar.ts  baz.ts  foo.ts  .gitignore
$ pando status
branch: master

tracked files with modifications:
  ➜ these will be automatically considered for commit
  ➜ use gl untrack <f> if you don't want to track changes to file f
  ➜ if file f was committed before, use gl checkout <f> to discard local changes

    foo.py
    bar.py

Untracked files:
  ➜ these won't be considered for commit)
  ➜ use gl track <f> if you want to track changes to file f
```
