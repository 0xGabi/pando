# Overview

The Pando Network rely on three different components.

1. **Organisms**. Organisms are pando-based content DAOs - software, books, articles, songs, etc. -  living on the blockchain as individuals of their own. You can think about these organisms as a pando equivalent of git remote repositories.
2. **Factories**. Factories allow user to locally extract, modify and submit updates to pando-hosted contents. You can think of these factories as a pando equivalent of git local repositories.
3. **Nodes**. Nodes are computer indexing the content of pando's public organisms to offer searchability, cross-organism reputation system, etc. The software run by these nodes is still being developed and is not released yet.
