# Overview

Pando is a distributed [versioning control system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) enforcing [DAO-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization) versioning, lineage tracking and governance. It is built on top of [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/), [ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) and [aragonOS](https://aragon.one/os). Its goal is to become a _de facto_ standard. Pando’s specification and implementation are thus intended to be open-source and community-driven.

One way to understand what pando is to think about it as a distributed alternative to traditional versioning systems like git. Another one is to think about it as a tool to track and govern the genesis of contents the same way an ecosystem works. A last one is to think about pando as a universal public infrastructure to create, host and link contents: softwares, writings, musics, videos, etc.

## Rationale

The core principles of pando are the following.

### Distributed

Pando implements a fully distributed architecture. Pando’s storage rely on IPFS while pando’s governance schemes are enforced through smart-contracts stored and executed on the Ethereum blockchain. This architecture guarantees that **contents hosted through pando are uncensorable and can survive most infrastructure breakdowns**.

### Immutable

Pando enforces content and governance immutability. This immutability is insured through the pairing of both IPFS and the Ethereum blockchain. It guarantees a timeless archiving and thus that **the contents produced through pando are uncensorable even by their own authors**. This features makes pando unique in the field of cooperation and versioning systems and, probably, not suited to all needs. That is why pando does not intend to replace existing cooperation and versioning systems such as git but to serve as the foundation of new practices, next to the existing ones.


### Modular

// TBD

Pando do not rely on a binary permission scheme where one is granted either full or no authority over a content. Pando is designed to grant each contributors of a content a given amount of authority over this content with respect to the « value » of their contributions.
