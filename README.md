## Background

This software is in a **very** alpha stage and is not meant to be used in production yet.

### Who are we ?

Pando is currently developed by the ryhope network and [wespr](http://www.wespr.co) teams.


Its development is backed by a grant from the [Aragon Nest](https://github.com/aragon/nest) program. However, pando intends to become a public library and infrastructure developed by the whole web3 / ethereum community: feel free to open issues, fork and open PR.

### Why pando ?

[Pando](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pando_(tree)) (Latin for "spread out"), also known as the Trembling Giant is a clonal colony of a single male quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) determined to be a single living organism by identical genetic markers and assumed to have one massive underground root system. The plant occupies 43 hectares (106 acres) and is estimated to weigh collectively 6,000,000 kilograms (6,600 short tons), making it the heaviest known organism. The root system of Pando, at an estimated 80,000 years old, is among the oldest known living organisms.
